# A small learn/test program about openGL

I study openGL on this.

## How to run

First use `cd` to get to current dir and run make commond to build and generate an executable file called 'main'.

`make`

Then run it.

`./main`

## Dir Structure

##### ./static/*

Some static img file are placed here. After you change the relative path or name of the file, remember to check `static.h`.

##### ./glsl/*

Some `.glsl` are placed here including source code of vertex shader and fragment shader.

##### ./hw-glutut/*

According to https://duriansoftware.com/joe/an-intro-to-modern-opengl.-table-of-contents.

You can find main code here.
